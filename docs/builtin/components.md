## Custom Components

Create a directory `components/` under your project root, and simply put your custom Vue components under it, then you can use it with the same name in your markdown file!

Read more in the [Customization](/custom/directory-structure#components) section.

## Theme-provided Components

Themes can provide components as well. Please read their documentations for what they have provided.

Check more in the [directory structure](/custom/directory-structure) section.
